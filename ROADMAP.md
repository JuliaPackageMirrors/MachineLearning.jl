Short-term TODO's
=================

1. Track & optionally show metadata and state during training 
2. Support minibatch sgd during neural net training

Longer term Roadmap
===================

1. Dataframe is key underlying datatype (as opposed to Matrix{Float64})
2. Principled supervised regression and classification types / support
3. Performance benchmarking and optimization
4. Robust sampling methods
5. Build out metrics, potentially break out as separate repo
6. Testing against more real world datasets
