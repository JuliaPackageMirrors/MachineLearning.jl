Short-term TODO's
=================

1. Track & optionally show metadata and state during training 
2. Regression support for RF/DT/Neural Nets

Longer term Roadmap
===================

1. Feature transformers
2. Pipeline support
3. Principled supervised regression and classification types / support
4. Performance benchmarking and optimization
5. Robust sampling methods
6. Build out metrics, potentially break out as separate repo
7. Dataframe is key underlying datatype (as opposed to Matrix{Float64})
