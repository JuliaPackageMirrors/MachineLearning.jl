Short-term TODO's
=================

1. BART for regression
2. Swap and change rule support in BART
3. Factor out an abstract Tree type
4. Support categorical predictors
5. Track & optionally show metadata and state during training 
6. Support minibatch sgd during neural net training
7. Supervised regression support for neural nets

Longer term Roadmap
===================

1. Dataframe is key underlying datatype (as opposed to Matrix{Float64})
2. Performance benchmarking and optimization
3. Robust sampling methods
4. Build out metrics, potentially break out as separate repo
5. Testing against more real world datasets
